# PyKX Documentation

## About

Welcome to [PyKX](./getting-started/what_is_pykx.md)! PyKX is a Python first interface to the world's fastest time-series database kdb+ and its underlying vector programming language, q.

For Python developers, PyKX unlocks the speed and power of kdb+ for data processing and storage from within your Python environment. It enables anyone with Python knowledge to apply analytics against vast amounts of data, both in-memory and on-disk, in a fraction of the time, allowing you to focus on getting the best from your data.

For q developers, PyKX brings together Python's data science ecosystem and the power of kdb+'s vector and time-series analytics. This makes them available in both q and Python environments. You can use it to run q code within a Python environment or embed Python analytics within your q session.

To begin your journey with PyKX, follow the sections below:
