# Configure PyKX 

_This page provides details on how to configure PyKX using a configuration file and/or environment variables._

To modify the underlying behavior of PyKX based on your specific use-case, check out your [options](#options) for use-case/performance tuned optimizations of the library. You can configure them using a [configuration file](#configuration-file) or [environment variables](#environment-variables) as described below. 

!!! warning "Important: In all cases, environment variable definitions take precedence over definitions within the configuration file."

## Configuration file

If you choose to use a configuration file `#!python .pykx-config` to define your options for PyKX initialization, here's an example of a `#!python .pykx-config` file which operates according to `#!python *.toml` syntax:

```bash
[default]
PYKX_IGNORE_QHOME="true"
PYKX_KEEP_LOCAL_TIMES="true"

[test]
PYKX_GC="true"
PYKX_RELEASE_GIL="true"

[beta]
PYKX_BETA_FEATURES="true"
```

On import of PyKX, the file `#!python .pykx-config` is searched for according to the following path ordering. The first location containing a `#!python .pykx-config` file is used for definition of the PyKX configuration:

| **Order** | **Location**                                     |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1.        | `Path('.')`                                      |
| 2.        | `Path(os.getenv('PYKX_CONFIGURATION_LOCATION'))` |
| 3.        | `Path.home()`                                    |

When loading this file, unless otherwise specified, PyKX uses the profile `#!python default`. To configure non-default profiles from within this file, set an environment variable `#!python PYKX_PROFILE` prior to loading of PyKX, for example using the above configuration file.

=== "default"

	```python
	>>> import pykx as kx
	>>> kx.config.ignore_qhome
        True
	```

=== "test"

	```python
	>>> import os
	>>> os.environ['PYKX_PROFILE'] = "test"
	>>> import pykx as kx
	>>> kx.config.k_gc
	True
	```

To add values to your configuration file you can modify the file directly or alternatively use the helper function `#!python kx.util.add_to_config` as follows for example

```python
>>> import pykx as kx
>>> kx.util.add_to_config({'PYKX_GC': 'True', 'PYKX_BETA_FEATURES': 'True'})

Configuration updated at: /Users/conormccarthy/.pykx-config.
Profile updated: default.
Successfully added:
	- PYKX_GC = True
	- PYKX_BETA_FEATURES = True
```

## Environment variables

If you wish to configure the [options](#options) as environment variables, before importing PyKX, you can, for example, define the environment variables to use: 

```python
>>> import os
>>> os.environ['PYKX_RELEASE_GIL'] = '1'
>>> os.environ['PYKX_GC'] = '1'
>>> import pykx as kx
>>> kx.config.k_gc
True
```

## Options

You have various options to tune PyKX behavior at run time. You must set these variables before importing PyKX. They remain effective throughout the execution of the PyKX process.

### General

To enable or disable advanced features of PyKX across all modes of operation, use the following variables:

| **Option**                      | **Default** | **Values**                                                            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PYKX_BETA_FEATURES`            | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | Enable all Beta features supplied with PyKX allowing users to test and prototype code slated for later releases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `PYKX_QDEBUG`                   | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | Enable retrieval of backtrace information on error being raised when executing q functions, this can alternatively be enabled by setting `debug=True` as a keyword in calls to `kx.q`.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `PYKX_IGNORE_QHOME`             | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | When loading PyKX on a machine with an existing q installation (and the environment variable `QHOME` set to the installation folder), PyKX will look within this directory for q scripts their dependencies. It will then symlink these files to make them available to load under PyKX. This variable instructs PyKX to not perform this symlinking.                                             |
| `PYKX_KEEP_LOCAL_TIMES`         | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | When converting a Python datetime object to q, PyKX will translate the Python datetime into UTC before the conversion. This variable instructs PyKX to convert the Python datetime using the local time zone.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `PYKX_ALLOCATOR`                | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | When converting a Numpy array to q, PyKX implements a full data copy in order to translate the Numpy array to q representation in memory. When this is set PyKX implements [NEP-49](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0049.html) which allows q to handle memory allocation of all Numpy arrays so they can be converted more efficiently to q. This avoids the need to resort to a copy where possible. |
| `PYKX_GC`                       | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | When PYKX_ALLOCATOR is enabled, PyKX can trigger q garbage collector when Numpy arrays allocated by PyKX are deallocated. This variable enables this behavior which will release q memory to the OS following deallocation of the Numpy array at the cost of a small overhead.                                                                                                                    |
| `PYKX_LOAD_PYARROW_UNSAFE`      | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | By default, PyKX uses a subprocess to import pyarrow as it can result in a crash when the version of pyarrow is incompatible. This variable will trigger a normal import of pyarrow and importing PyKX should be slightly faster.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `PYKX_MAX_ERROR_LENGTH`         | `256`       | size in characters                                                    | By default, PyKX reports IPC connection errors with a message buffer of size 256 characters. This allows the length of these error messages to be modified reducing the chance of excessive error messages polluting logs.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `PYKX_NOQCE`                    | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | On Linux, PyKX comes with q Cloud Edition features from [Insights Core](https://code.kx.com/insights/core/). This variable allows a user to skip the loading of q Cloud Edition functionality, saving some time when importing PyKX but removing access to possibly supported additional functionality.                                                                                           |
| `PYKX_Q_LIB_LOCATION`           | `UNSET`     | Path to a directory containing q libraries necessary for loading PyKX | See [here](../release-notes/changelog.md#pykx-131) for detailed information. This allows a user to centralise the q libraries, `q.k`, `read.q`, `libq.so` etc to a managed location within their environment which is decentralised from the Python installation. This is required for some enterprise use-cases.                                                                                 |
| `PYKX_RELEASE_GIL`              | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | When PYKX_RELEASE_GIL is enabled the Python Global Interpreter Lock will not be held when calling into q.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `PYKX_Q_LOCK`                   | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | When PYKX_Q_LOCK is enabled a re-entrant lock is added around calls into q, this lock will stop multiple threads from calling into q at the same time. This allows embedded q to be thread safe even when using PYKX_RELEASE_GIL.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `PYKX_DEBUG_INSIGHTS_LIBRARIES` | `False`     | `1` or `true`                                                         | If the insights libraries failed to load this variable can be used to print out the full error output for debugging purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

To set the environment for q (embedded in PyKX, in licensed mode), use the variables below:


| **Variable** | **Values**                                                               | **Description**                                                                                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `QARGS`      | See link                                                                 | Command-line flags to pass to q, see [here](https://code.kx.com/q/basics/cmdline/) for more information.                 |
| `QHOME`      | Path to the users q installation folder                                  | See [here](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/install/#step-5-edit-your-profile) for more information.                          |
| `QLIC`       | Path to the folder where the q license should be found                   | See [here](https://code.kx.com/q/learn/install/#step-5-edit-your-profile) for more information.                          |
| `QINIT`      | Path to an additional `*.q` file loaded after `PyKX` has initialized     | See [here](https://code.kx.com/q4m3/14_Introduction_to_Kdb%2B/#1481-the-environment-variables) for more information.     |

If no license is found, set the following variables either in configuration or as environment variables to define the `kc.lic` or `k4.lic` license used by PyKX:

| **Variable**        | **Description**                                                                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `KDB_LICENSE_B64`   | This should contain the base-64 encoded contents of a valid `kc.lic` file with `pykx` enabled. |
| `KDB_K4LICENSE_B64` | This should contain the base-64 encoded contents of a valid `k4.lic` file with `pykx` enabled. |

#### PyKX QARGS supported additions

When using PyKX, you can define `#!python QARGS` to modify its behavior during initialization in a Linux environment. Here are some of the values you can use for `#!python QARGS`:

| **Input**      | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--no-qce`     | Ensure that no kdb Insights libraries are loaded at initialization of PyKX.     |
| `--no-kurl`    | Ensure that the kdb Insights `kurl` library is not loaded at initialization.    |
| `--no-objstor` | Ensure that the kdb Insights `objstor` library is not loaded at initialization. |
| `--no-qlog`    | Ensure that the kdb Insights `qlog` library is not loaded at initialization.    |
| `--no-sql`     | Ensure that the kdb Insights `sql` library is not loaded at initialization.     |

### PyKX under q

You can load PyKX and [use it from a q session](../pykx-under-q/intro.md). The following variables are specific to this mode of operation:

| **Variable**              | **Values**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
