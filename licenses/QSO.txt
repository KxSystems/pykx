 1. LICENSE GRANTS 

1.1 Grant of License. KX hereby grants End User a non-transferable, non-exclusive license, without right of sublicense, to install and use the Software solely for the purpose of compiling and running the PyKX software made available by KX under separate licensing terms. End User will not attempt to circumvent any restrictions imposed on the Software or use the Software for any purpose other than stated above.

End User agrees that it is reasonable that KX shall have no liability of any kind in any circumstances to it or a third party for any breach of the foregoing. 

1.3 Software Performance. End User shall not distribute or otherwise make available to any third party any report regarding the performance of the Software, Software benchmarks or any information from such a report. 

1.4 Intellectual Property Ownership Rights. End User acknowledges and agrees that KX owns all rights, title and interest in and to the Software and in and to all of KX’s patents, trademarks, trade names, inventions, copyrights, know-how and trade secrets relating to its design, manufacture and operation, including all inventions, customizations, enhancements, improvements, updates, derivative works and other modifications and all related rights shall automatically vest in KX immediately upon creation. You will not register any trademark, patent or copyright which uses or references the Software. The use by End User of such proprietary rights is authorized only for the purposes set forth herein, and upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, such authorization will cease.

KX DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET END USER REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. 

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. WE DO NOT EXCLUDE OR LIMIT IN ANY WAY OUR LIABILITY TO END USER WHERE IT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL TO DO SO. SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING SENTENCE, KX SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, NOR FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGE TO REPUTATION, LOSS OF EARNINGS AND INJURY TO FEELINGS IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF KX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Upon termination of this Agreement or at any time upon KX’s written request, End User shall permanently delete or destroy all copies of the Software in its possession. 

7. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION. This Agreement and all related documents and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement whether in contract, tort, or statute shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, except as to copyright matters covered by U.S. Federal Law. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of New York, and it will not commence any action, litigation, or proceeding of any kind whatsoever against any other party in any way arising from or relating to this Agreement and all contemplated transactions, including, but not limited to, contract, equity, tort, fraud, and statutory claims, in any forum other than the State of New York (except as permitted by KX as detailed below). End User hereby waives any objections to venue in those courts. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any such action, litigation, or proceeding is conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Should any provision of this Agreement be declared unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then such provision shall be deemed to be severed from this Agreement and shall not affect the remainder hereof. Furthermore, with respect to a violation by End User of Section 1 (License Grant), KX will have the right at its discretion to seek remedies in courts of competent jurisdiction within any applicable territory. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer information Transactions Act, as currently enacted by any jurisdiction or as may be codified or amended from time to time by any jurisdiction, do not apply to this Agreement. 

8. TRADE CONTROL. You acknowledge that Software (including its related technical data and services) may be deemed dual use and is subject to, without limitation, the export control laws and regulations of the United Kingdom, European Union, and United States of America (“Trade Control Laws”). You agree to fully comply with those Trade Control Laws in connection with Software including where applicable assisting in obtaining any necessary governmental approvals, licenses and undertakings. You will not, and will not allow any third party, to use, export, re-export or transfer, directly or indirectly, of any part of the Software in violation of any Trade Control Laws or to a destination subject to US, UN, EU, UK or Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) embargo, or to any individual or entity listed on the denied parties’ lists. A statement on the Export Controls applicable to the Software, is available at the following website: Export Statement – KX. Any dispute in relation to this clause 8 shall be governed in accordance with clause 7 unless Trade Control Laws determine otherwise. You acknowledge that we may not be permitted (and, in such an event, shall be excused from any requirement) to deliver or grant access to the Software, or perform support or services, due to an embargo, trade sanction or other comparable restrictive measure. 

9. GENERAL. This is the only Agreement between End User and KX relating to the Software. The provisions of section 1.4 (“Intellectual Property Ownership Rights”), section 4 (“No Warranty”), section 5 (“Limitation of Liability”), section 6 (“Term and Termination”), section 9 (“General”) shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason. All other rights and obligations of the parties shall cease upon termination of this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, and representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. You agree that you shall have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in this Agreement. You agree that you shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in this Agreement. Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted under this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement grants, by implication, waiver, estoppel, or otherwise, to you or any third party. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Agreement, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
